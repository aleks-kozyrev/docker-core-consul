#ENV CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG='{"skip_leave_on_interrupt": true}'
#Note also Consul team have set skip_leave_on_interrupt using the CONSUL_LOCAL_CONFIG environment variable. This is recommended for servers and will be defaulted to true in Consul 0.7 and later, so this will no longer be necessary.

# kick off Consul with the default argument for EdgeX
